#Welcome to my project!

#I'm HansaPilsner(Aka Boxcel) the head dev (and only one as of now) on this project, let's just get right into it!

#What is my intentions with this project?
#I'm planning on making a personal database of central WI weather for scientific research.

#Aren't you a highschooler?
#Yes I am, but I want to make a program that can help people see and track their weather with a scientific amount of detail.

#How long can this take?
#I wish I knew, but I will complete it.

#Can You Help?
#Yes!, any help is good help, just message my personal email (found in the security file) and I will get back to you to add you on.
